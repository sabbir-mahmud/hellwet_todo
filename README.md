# To-Do Application with React, Redux, and Firebase

To-Do application using a stack of technologies including React.js, Redux.js, Tailwind CSS, daisyui, Firebase, and react-toastify. This application will allow users to manage their tasks, set due dates, and ensure secure authentication using JWT and email/password or Google login.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux.js**: A state management library for managing application state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to style your application quickly.
- **daisyui**: A set of plugins for Tailwind CSS to streamline UI development.
- **Firebase**: A powerful Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides authentication, database, and hosting services.
- **react-toastify**: A popular library for displaying notification messages.

## Features of the To-Do Application

### Task Management
1. **Create New Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with or without due dates, making it easy to track their to-do items. A user-friendly interface ensures seamless task creation.

2. **Update Tasks**: Users have the flexibility to update any task. They can modify the task description and due date as needed, keeping their to-do list current.

3. **View Task List**: A clean and organized table format displays the list of tasks, making it easy for users to see all their to-do items at a glance.

4. **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete any task from the table, removing completed or unnecessary items from their list.

### Authentication
1. **Secure Communication**: JWT is used to ensure secure communication between the server and the client side, safeguarding user data and authentication.

2. **User Registration**: Users can register using their email and password. A user-friendly registration process ensures a smooth onboarding experience.

3. **Google Login**: In addition to email and password registration, users can also log in using their Google account, offering a convenient and familiar authentication option.

## Setting up the Project

Before we delve into the code, make sure you have the necessary tools and setup:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. **Firebase Setup**: Create a Firebase project on the Firebase console and configure Firebase authentication.

3. **React App Setup**: Create a new React application using `create-react-app`.

4. **Redux Setup**: Set up Redux for state management.

5. **Tailwind CSS and daisyui**: Install and configure Tailwind CSS with daisyui for styling.

6. **Firebase Integration**: Integrate Firebase with your React app for authentication and data storage.

## Building the To-Do Application

For brevity, we won't provide the full code in this document. Instead, you can follow a step-by-step guide or tutorial online that covers each of these technologies and their integration.

Here's a simplified overview of the steps:

1. Create React components for the to-do list, task creation, task update, and task deletion.

2. Use Redux to manage the state of your application, including the list of tasks.

3. Implement Firebase authentication for user registration and Google login.

4. Connect Firebase's Realtime Database to store and retrieve tasks.

5. Style your application using Tailwind CSS and daisyui to create an attractive user interface.

6. Utilize react-toastify for displaying notifications.

This application will not only help you master these technologies but also provide a practical example of building a feature-rich web application with user authentication and data management.

Remember to consult the documentation and tutorials for each technology to ensure a smooth development process. Happy coding!
